#Presidential Debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump

## Presidential Debate
This is the application that runs the debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Since this is a great Debate season, this seemed relevant. 

# Getting Started
If you would like to play around with the code, then download this project. Then, on the project level, you need to build the gradle. Alternatively, you can also open the project with build.gradle and it will be built at the start.

## Current Implementation
Currently, this runs in Java and has Springboot configuration. I am making the web app version of this. Depends on how much time I have. If you want to test locally from your 
IDE, try running ExecuteModel file.
